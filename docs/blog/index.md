# Blog

Welcome to the **moudrick.net** blog!  

This space will soon host updates, notes, and technical explorations related to ongoing and past projects.  
Before new posts appear here, you’re welcome to visit a pair of my earlier, old-fashioned technical blogs that remain publicly available:

- [techblog.moudrick.net](https://techblog.moudrick.net/){: .md-ext }
- [techreading.moudrick.net](https://techreading.moudrick.net/){: .md-ext }

Stay tuned — the new blog will be powered by the 
[Material for MkDocs blog plugin](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-a-blog/){: .md-ext }
and will gradually evolve with fresh content.
